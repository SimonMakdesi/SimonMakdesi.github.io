                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>This is a mind boggling math game. It consists of several challenges, increasing in difficulty level. The player has to reach the goal number with the use of a fixed set of numbers and operators. This has to be done within the amount of "operations remaning".</p>

                <h3>The idea</h3>
                <p>The idea was to make a challenging mental arithmetic game designed almost like an IQ test. The player starts out with a number ("your number") and then has to reach the "goal number" using the available numbers and operators for each question. The player has an X amount of attempts before failing.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>The challenge of this game was to acutally make the game challenging. My colleague and I wanted to design each question so that they could be solved in multiple different ways. We wanted the player to be able to tackle every questions in their own way. As we play tested the game, we noticed that the design indeed supported different playing styles. Some struggled while others had creative ways in which to solve each puzzle by thinking "outside the box". </p>
